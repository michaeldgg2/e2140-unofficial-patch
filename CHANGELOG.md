## 1.0.0-alpha

Works only with Earth 2140 Trilogy published on GOG platform!
This version's primary purpose is to get community feedback regarding patch installation. Main concern is Windows administration rights requirement and anti-virus software interactions. From gameplay standpoint, almost all AI issues are resolved, however AI player sometimes can stuck in producing infinite number of TUR/HAT units.

### Fixed
- AI players are not producing any units in their construction centers and factories (unless they are hit and repaired!)
- Virtual generals are not working
- Minelaying units do not lay mines
- Game crashes when KT30 attacks enemy building
- Game wipes out AI-related data when loaded from "save game"
- Building windows get transparent instead of black when power is turn off
- Tracked units tracks are transparent instead of black
